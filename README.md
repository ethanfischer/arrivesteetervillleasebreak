# Breaking Arrive Streeterville Lease

Tuesday, Oct 7, 2025

We spoke with Tim Cherwin this morning in person to figure out what our options are in terms of breaking our lease. He asked for us to email him the mold report and said he would get back to us. 

He called me at 1:34 PM but i let it go to voicemail

Sneha and I called him back at 2:48 PM and he informed us the only option is what's in the lease. 60 days (paid) to move out plus equal to two months rent. A.k.a, 4 months rent (> $8000)

I'm now compiling all my notes and pictures so we can pursue the RLTO route. We called the Tenants Rights Hotline at 2:58 PM but didn't get an answer. Left them a voicemail.
